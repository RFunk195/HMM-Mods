---INTRODUCTION---
Ever wondered why Dragon Road Night Act 1 ends rather abruptly despite there seemingly being more area to explore? Well, after all the research, documentation, and leaks, the full director's cut of the level has now been unlocked for Unleashed Recompiled!

This mod for Dragon Road Night Act 1 unlocks the latter half of the level that was scrapped from the final base game. With mod configuration, you are able to choose between the unaltered beta layout from the October 14, 2008 prototype build (ported to Unleashed Recompiled from this mod by archxe) or a custom made layout that keeps the final version of Act 1 with the beta layout in the latter half. This makes it so the level ends next to the Gaia Gate as originally intended, hence the title. Additionally, with the Chun-nan Adventure Pack DLC installed, Act 1-2 will have a layout that stitches Acts 1 and 1-2 together. The configuration menu also enables the ability to toggle the beta locations for medals and media, as well as an optional tweak to the rank requirements to scale for the level's larger size, recommended only for the most experienced Werehog enjoyers!
