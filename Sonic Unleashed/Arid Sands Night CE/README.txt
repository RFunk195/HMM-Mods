---INTRODUCTION---
Ever wondered what's behind the locked door at the end of Arid Sands Night Act 1? Well, after all the research, documentation, and leaks, the full director's cut of the level has now been unlocked for Unleashed Recompiled!

This mod for Arid Sands Night Act 1 unlocks the latter half of the level that was cut from the final base game. With mod configuration, you are able to choose between the unaltered beta layout from the October 14, 2008 prototype build (ported to UR from this mod by archxe https://gamebanana.com/mods/430741) or a custom made layout that keeps the final version of Act 1 with the beta layout in the latter half. This makes it so the level ends next to the Dark Guardian boss arena as originally intended, hence the title. Additionally, with the Apotos & Shamar Adventure Pack DLC installed, Act 2 will have a layout that stitches Acts 1 and 2 together. The configuration menu also enables the ability to toggle the beta locations for medals and media, as well as a tweak to the rank requirements to scale for the level's larger size, recommended only for the most experienced Werehog enjoyers!

Two additional tidbits to note:
- All layouts let you have access to the shortcut to the beta area that's normally blocked off in both Act 1 and 2.
- The infamous kaizo fight room in Act 1 has been slightly tweaked to not take as long. The reason why the purple wall keeping you in tends not to disappear is because the arena's Dark Masters spawn one at a time in a baffling 20 seconds after the prior one's been killed. This has been changed so they now spawn 1 second apart like the other enemies. This still means having fight 20 enemies in total to escape, so still only enter that room at your own risk!
